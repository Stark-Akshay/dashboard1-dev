## Developing an UI design from internet

#Overview
I am developing a random UI which I saw on the internet to increase my pace and efficiency in writing code. Since I am a front end developer I am mainly doing this to focus more on industry standard code making the UI look as close to the design given below. I do not have access to the assets provided in the video. So I am using Icons which I have access through the internet and also building components on my own.
